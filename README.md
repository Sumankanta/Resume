# Sumankanta Padhan

Hello! I'm Sumankanta Padhan, an MCA graduate (Class of 2024) from Sambalpur University with a strong foundation in computer science and a deep interest in web development, data analytics, and cloud technologies. I am passionate about turning data into actionable insights, building real-world applications, and continuously exploring new tools and technologies that shape the future of IT.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on a range of academic and personal projects, gaining hands-on experience in technologies such as Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Excel, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. My internship at CTTC, Bhubaneswar gave me valuable industry exposure, where I developed a Student Social Media Analysis Dashboard using Power BI, Tableau, and Excel to examine behavioral trends, academic performance, and mental health impacts.

I’ve also completed the Architecting with Google Compute Engine certification from Coursera, and a virtual internship in Data Analytics with Deloitte Australia through Forage, which helped deepen my understanding of cloud infrastructure and practical data workflows.

Some of my featured projects include:
- A **Student Social Media Analysis Dashboard** using Power BI and Tableau to visualize behavioral and academic insights.
- A **Netflix Insights Dashboard** that uncovers global streaming trends and regional content preferences.
- A responsive **Institutional Website** developed using modern web technologies.
- A lightweight **To-Do List App** built with JavaScript and Local Storage for task persistence.

I am always excited to collaborate on innovative projects, contribute to meaningful solutions, and grow alongside a team of passionate professionals. I’m currently seeking opportunities in the areas of software development, data analytics, or cloud-based technologies.
